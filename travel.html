										We are thrilled for you all to come visit us in New York City!  Read on for details about booking travel and getting around the city.  Temperatures near the wedding date will likely be 70-80&#176;F (21-26.5&#176;C).
									</p>
									<p>
										The above interactive map shows the locations of the area's airports, the hotel blocks, the venue, and our New York recommendations.  You can view the map key by clicking the top-left button or open the map in a new tab by clicking hte top-right button.

									<!--<p>
										No pressure, but if your travel plans allow, please join us for a low-key gathering at <a href="https://www.essexmarket.nyc/" target="_blank">Essex Market</a> the Thursday night before.  We would also love the opportunity to spend more time with you the weekend after the wedding if possible!

											<h3>Hotel Blocks</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											We have arranged a number of hotel options in New York for Thursday night through Sunday morning (i.e, earliest check-in would be August 17 with latest check-out on August 20).  Please make use of these options by July 18, 2023.  We include approximate prices per night for each hotel, but note that these prices do not include taxes (14.75% + $3.50 per night).
										</p>
										<p>
											The Lexington Hotel, located in Midtown, is the most North of the options (near-ish Time Square) and is our cheapest Manhattan option.  The Evelyn and James Hotel are in the Flatiron District and are near many of our suggestions.  Liberty View is just a few blocks from the venue but further from most other things.
										</p>

										</p>
										
										<h4>Other Options</h4>
										<p>
											Many other lodging options are available in New York in different locations and for different price points.  If you have any issues finding lodging, please reach out to us!
										</p>
										<p>
											For Manhattan, the cheapest options tend to be near Times Square or just south of Central Park.  Brooklyn and Queens also offer good, cheaper options; they are just less central, so plan for longer travel times.  There are pretty strict restrictions on Air BnBs in the city, so expect options there to be sparse or consist of single rooms in host-occupied apartments.

											<h3>Airports</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											There are three airports serving the New York area--LaGuardia, JFK, and Newark.  Newark tends to have the most affordable flights and is a NJ Transit train ride away from Manhattan.  LaGuardia really is better than it once was.  JFK is two MTA-run trains from Manhattan.  See the <a href="#subway">"Getting Around the City"</a> section for more MTA information.
										</p>
										<p>
											If you plan on flying in on Friday, we strongly advise picking a flight that lands before 1 PM.
										</p>
										<h4>LaGuardia Airport</h4>
										<p>
											<span class="icon solid fa-subway"> The free Q70-SBS (Special Bus Service) leaves from all LaGuardia terminals; follow signs for "Buses/Shuttles".  Take the Q70 to Roosevelt Ave/74th street (the first stop).  Transfers are then available to the E (blue), F/M (orange), or R (yellow) subway to get into Manhattan.
										</p>
										<p>
											<span class="icon solid fa-car-side"></span> From LaGuardia Airport to Manhattan, a taxi runs about ~$35 while an Uber is ~$55.
										</p>
										<p>
											<b>Pro tip</b>: Do not sleep on the 25-foot aqua-graphic curtain in Terminal B.  Every 15 minutes it does a cute little water, light, and audio show.  Step aside, Bellagio!
										</p>
										<h4>JFK Airport</h4>
										<p>
											<span class="icon solid fa-subway"> The Jamaica AirTrain (red) leaves from all terminals to the Jamaica subway station.  No payment is required to board, but there is an $8 exit fee at Jamaica station that you must pay using a MetroCard.  Right before the exit turnstiles, there is a line of MetroCard machines for purchasing new cards or reloading a card.  We suggest getting a card with at least $10.75 on it.  From Jamaica station, take the E (blue, $2.75 fare) to midtown Manhattan.  Getting to the E from the AirTrain exit will be a long enough walk that you will start to get worried, but it is a well labeled walk and you will be fine.
										</p>
										<p>
											<span class="icon solid fa-car-side"></span> A taxi/Uber from JFK Airport to Manhattan costs on average ~$60-75.
										</p>
										<h4>Newark Airport</h4>
										<p>
											<span class="icon solid fa-subway"> We recommend taking the AirTrain from your terminal to the RailLink station.  At the RailLink station, board any <a href="https://www.njtransit.com/airport"target="_blank">NJ Transit train</a> heading to New York to arrive at New York Penn Station.  Tickets can be bought at the RailLink station ($15.50 for one way adult).  Trains arrive every 15-20 minutes.
										</p>
										<p>
											<span class="icon solid fa-car-side"></span> A taxi/Uber from Newark Airport to Manhattan costs on average ~$55-60.
										</p>
										<p>
											<span class="icon brands fa-canadian-maple-leaf"></span> For our friends to the North, we have had good success using <a href="https://www.flyporter.com/en-ca/" target="_blank">Porter Airlines</a>, a budget airline that flies from much of eastern Canada to Newark Airport.

											<h3>Getting Around the City</h3>
										</header>
										<h4><span class="icon solid fa-walking"></span> Walking</h4>
										<p>
											Manhattan is extremely walkable and safe.  Walking 10 streets (i.e., walking north/south) is about half a mile (0.8 km); walking between avenues (i.e., walking east/west) is equivalent to approximately 1/7 a mile (0.2 km).
										</p>

										<h4><span class="icon solid fa-subway"></span> MTA</h4>
										<p>
											The fare for subways and buses is typically $2.75 (increasing to $2.90 on Aug. 20), which can be paid with any payment method that has tap functionality (i.e., a credit card or your phone if you're one of those people) or with a MetroCard.  MetroCards can be purchased at most subway stops.  All new MetroCards come with a $1 fee.  You can also purchase and use an <a href="https://omny.info/omny-card" target="_blank">OMNY card</a>, the fancy new tap-able MetroCard replacement.  You can buy them at most pharmacies and convenience stores. 
										</p>
										<p>
											<b>Pro tip</b>: Some subway entrances only allow access to subways going in one direction.  Make sure to read the subway station sign before dashing down/up any stairs.
										</p>

										<h4><span class="icon solid fa-car-side"></span> Driving</h4>
										<p>
											There's a reason the NYC taxi is so iconic.  Driving in the city is sometimes scary, always annoying, and nearly never necessary.  Street parking is available for the patient and the skilled, though for longer stays we recommend finding a parking garage.  Do not park within 15 feet of a fire hydrant.  Do not turn right on red.
										</p>
										<!--<p>
											For rideshare apps, Uber is somehow always cheaper than Lyft.

											<h3>Weather</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											New York in late August tends to have lows around 70&#176;F (21&#176;C) and highs around 80&#176;F (26.7&#176;C).  During the wedding, temperatures are likely to start at around 80&#176;F (26.7&#176;C) and drop to around 73&#176;F (22.7&#176;C) by the end of the event.  It can get humid in August, but will only rain on 9-13 days throughout the month.

											<h3>Things To Do</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											New York City definitely has things to do.  A very reasonable number of recommendations are marked on the map linked below (which is also embedded at the top of this page).  If there's somewhere you especially want to go, we suggest making a reservation ahead of time.  Targeting lunch-time or an early dinner (think like 5 PM) are good ways to get into busy restaurants.
