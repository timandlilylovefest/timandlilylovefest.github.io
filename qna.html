											<h3>Pre-Wedding</h3>
										</header>
										<h4>What is the best way to RSVP?  When is the RSVP deadline?</h4>
										<p>
											The wedding invites are accompanied by RSVP cards--one card for each guest.  We ask that a RSVP card for each guest is returned by <b>June 8th</b>.  If your RSVP needs to change, please e-mail us as soon as possible at timandlilylovefest@gmail.com.
										</p>
										<h4>What should I do if I cannot make it?</h4>
										<p>
											We're going to cry!  If you cannot make it, please let us know as soon as possible and RSVP no.  This is the worst news, but we begrudgingly understand and will miss you greatly!
										</p>
										<h4>How will you communicate any updates or changes before the wedding?</h4>
										<p>
											Any needed updates and changes will be sent via e-mail.  This website will also be updated with more information as the event draws closer.

											<h3>Wedding</h3>
										</header>
										<h4>At what time should I arrive to the venue?</h4>
										<p>
											Guests are welcome up to the rooftop of Brooklyn Grange, Sunset Park starting at 5 PM on the day.  We encourage you to check travel times early and often given possible rush hour complications.  The drive from midtown Manhattan to the venue can take 30 minutes to an hour and 30 minutes depending on conditions.
										</p>
										<h4>What time does Lily think the ceremony is starting?</h4>
										<p>
											We are all going to tell Lily the wedding starts an hour before it really does, and we are all going to keep hoping she finally shows up to something on time.  It is her day after all.
										</p>
										<h4>What is there to do around the venue?</h4>
										<p>
											<a href="https://industrycity.com/visit/" target="_blank">Industry City</a>, which is just two blocks south of Brooklyn Grange, Sunset Park, is exactly everything you would expect Brooklyn to be.  The space threads through several buildings containing shops and restaurants.  In between the buildings are courtyards teeming with art installations.  We almost suggest you purposefully show up early just to wander around, but please do not get hopelessly lost inside and please save your appetite!
										</p>
										<h4>What is the phone policy for the wedding?</h4>
										<p>
											Feel free to use your phones during the cocktail hour and after dinner.  We ask that you otherwise keep devices out of sight, especially during the ceremony and first dance.  Don't worry, we will one thousand percent be over sharing all of our wedding photos at you.
										</p>
										<!--<h4>What is your wedding hashtag?</h4>
										<p>
											If you come up with a good one, please let us know.
										</p>-->
										<h4>Will there be an open bar?</h4>
										<p>
											There sure will be!  A selection of wine, beer, and soft drinks will be available all night along with two signature cocktails devised by the Brooklyn Grange (see the <a href="dayof.html#menu" target="_blank">Menu</a> for the cocktail details).
										</p>

											<h3>Venue</h3>
										</header>
										<!--<h4>Will there be provided transportation to and/or from the hotel(s) to the venue?</h4>
										<p>
											Unfortunately not, please see the <a href="dayof.html"target="_blank">day off</a> page for details about how to get there. Also feel free to reach out if you have more details questions.
										</p>-->
										<h4>Will the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception take place indoors or outdoors?</h4>
										<p>
											Weather permitting, the ceremony will take place outside in a partially-covered area.  The cocktail hour will largely take place outside while the dinner and dancing will be indoors.  The outdoor space will be available for lounging (and cornhole!) throughout the entire night.
										</p>
										<p>
											See the <a href="travel.html"target="_blank">Travel</a> page for expected weather information.
										</p>
										<h4>Can I bring my dog?</h4>
										<p>
											Since Brooklyn Grange, Sunset Park is a working farm, sadly (tragically) dogs are not allowed.  Please bring pictures of your dog.  We will ask to see them.
										</p>
										<h4>Is the venue ADA accessible?</h4>
										<p>
											The venue is accessed by elevator.  All areas of the venue are accessible by wheelchair.
										</p>
										<h4>Did Courtney Love film a music video with Fall Out Boy at the venue?</h4>
										<p>
											No.
										</p>
										<h4>May I take some of the flowers from the table home?</h4>
										<p>
											Sure can!  Our intrepid florist, Molly Oliver will be returning at 11:30 PM to assemble the table decorations into bouquets for guests!  Say hi to her; she is lovely.
										</p>

											Yes, a private room at the back of the main venue space can be used if desired.
										</p>
										<h4>Is there a changing table available?</h4>
										<p>
											A
										</p>
										<h4>What meal options are available for young children?</h4>
